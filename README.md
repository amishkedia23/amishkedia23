## üìù My Projects

### 1. **MathCrypt Secure Algorithm**
- **Category**: Algorithm Design
- **Description**: Data security in MathCrypt is achieved through a combi- nation of secure key exchange, strong encryption, and robust numerical techniques. By employing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, MathCrypt ensures that keys are exchanged securely, even over unsecured channels. The encryption pro- cess utilizes one-way functions to convert plaintext to cipher- text, ensuring that only the intended recipient with the appro- priate key can decrypt the message. The use of numerical root- finding methods, such as the Bisection, Newton-Raphson, and Secant methods, further strengthens the encryption process, making it computationally infeasible for attackers to reverse- engineer the ciphertext.
- **Technologies**: Python

### 2. **Crypto Price Prediction Bot**
- **Category**: Applications
- **Description**: Provided visualization of historical and pre- dicted prices through interactive charts, and oÔ¨Äered actionable insights such as current price, predicted closing price, and trading rec- ommendations (Buy/Sell/Hold) based on SMA analysis. Developed an app for predicting and analyzing cryptocurrency prices using advanced tech- niques like ARIMA modeling and Simple Mov- ing Average (SMA) analysis.
- **Technologies**: Python , MySQL.

### 3. **Study Buddy App**
- **Category**: Web Development
- **Description**: Created a specialized app for VIT students, integrating an AI feature that consolidates responses from multiple AI platforms, along with an inbuilt PDF reader and MCQ generator.
- **Technologies**: React, Node.js

### 4. **GestureSpeakAI**
- **Category**: Applications
- **Description**: Developed an AI-based hands-free communication tool for people with physical limitations, using gesture recognition, language processing, and speech synthesis.
- **Technologies**: Python, Machine Learning, Speech Synthesis
